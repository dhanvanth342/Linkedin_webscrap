      "description": "Hi I'm Sanjyot Dahale. I have two passions, to create video games and to play video games. I am a programmer by heart and I love to learn and teach programming. Game Development is my passion and I have been learning game development since I was 16 years old. I have developed a few games throughout my time using the Unity Engine and I'm currently learning the Unreal Engine. I also have a lot of interest in other fields like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Internet of Things.<br><br>The phrase 'Jack of all trades, Master of None' does not apply in today's world but its updated version 'Be the Jack of all trades and a Master of one' is definitely the one which we should follow, hence being constantly updated in current technology has always been my goal. <br><br>I was the founding member of the IEEE Student Branch of our college and have been a integral part of the Student Branch since then. I was the Treasurer and a part of the Executive Committee of the IEEE SSJCOE Student Branch in the year 2018-2019 and I have been an active participant in all the activities of the Student Branch. Being a programmer, I have conducted a lot of workshops and competitions on the topics of Programming and Game Development. I have also conducted some team building and networking sessions which help the students to connect with each other, helps in team-building and also helps to induce confidence into the students."
